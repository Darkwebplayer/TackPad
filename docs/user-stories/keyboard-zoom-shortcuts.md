# Keyboard Shortcuts for Zoom Controls

## Overview
As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts (`+` and `-` keys) to quickly zoom in and out of the board view, so that I can navigate the board more efficiently without relying on mouse or touch gestures.

## User Story
**As a** board user  
**I want** to use keyboard shortcuts to control zoom level  
**So that** I can quickly adjust my view without interrupting my workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pressing the `+` key should zoom in on the board
2. Pressing the `-` key should zoom out on the board
3. The zoom shortcuts should work regardless of the current input focus (unless typing in a text field)
4. Visual feedback should be provided when zooming (e.g., smooth transition)
5. The zoom level should respect the minimum and maximum zoom boundaries

## Technical Details
- Implement keyboard event listeners for `+` and `-` keys
- Integrate with existing zoom functionality in the board component
- Ensure the shortcuts don't interfere with text input fields
- Add smooth transition animations for zoom changes

## Related Features
- Current zoom controls
- Auto-zoom functionality

## Testing Scenarios
1. Test `+` key zooms in correctly
2. Test `-` key zooms out correctly
3. Verify shortcuts work in different board states
4. Ensure shortcuts don't trigger while typing in text fields
5. Test zoom boundaries are respected
6. Verify smooth transitions during zoom changes
